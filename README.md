# HeroFinder
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our superhero HeroFinder! Our site allows users to search for their favorite superheroes or generate a random superhero with a unique set of powers and abilities.

Our website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python(Django) and we use API calls to fetch data about superheroes from various comic book publishers, including Marvel and DC. We also use JavaScript to dynamically generate superhero images and display detailed information about their capabilities and powers.

The code in this repository is organized into various folders and files, including the HTML and CSS files for the website's layout, as well as JavaScript files for handling user input and API calls with Python(Django) for User authentication such as User Registration, Login and Logout.

Our website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a search bar that allows users to enter the name of their favorite superhero and find detailed information about them. The random superhero generator provides an exciting way to discover new superheroes and their unique abilities.

Feel free to explore our code and contribute to our project by submitting pull requests or reporting issues.
